# GDdemo

Gradient Descent demo for WeChat public account: KevinGrocery

Including gradient descent calculation for a simple linear regression model.

# How to use

Just run myGD.py

# How to change input

You can change the input data points by hand

or if you like, read from a .csv file(you'll need to use readfromcsv method)

And you can change the hyperparameters such as learningrate and number of iterations to see how it changes.

Thanks~
